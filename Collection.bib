abstract = {BACKGROUND In computed tomography (CT), the spot geometry is one of the main sources of error in CT images. Since X-rays do not arise from a point source, artefacts are produced. In particular there is a penumbra effect, leading to poorly defined edges within a reconstructed volume. Penumbra models can be simulated given a fixed spot geometry and the known experimental setup. OBJECTIVE This paper proposes to use a penumbra model, derived from Beer's law, both to confirm spot geometry from penumbra data, and to quantify blurring in the image. METHODS Two models for the spot geometry are considered; one consists of a single Gaussian spot, the other is a mixture model consisting of a Gaussian spot together with a larger uniform spot. RESULTS The model consisting of a single Gaussian spot has a poor fit at the boundary. The mixture model (which adds a larger uniform spot) exhibits a much improved fit. The parameters corresponding to the uniform spot are similar across all powers, and further experiments suggest that the uniform spot produces only soft X-rays of relatively low-energy. CONCLUSIONS Thus, the precision of radiographs can be estimated from the penumbra effect in the image. The use of a thin copper filter reduces the size of the effective penumbra.},

abstract = {The introduction of spectral CT imaging in the form of fast clinical dual-energy CT enabled contrast material to be differentiated from other radiodense materials, improved lesion detection in contrast-enhanced scans, and changed the way that existing iodine and barium contrast materials are used in clinical practice. More profoundly, spectral CT can differentiate between individual contrast materials that have different reporter elements such that high-resolution CT imaging of multiple contrast agents can be obtained in a single pass of the CT scanner. These spectral CT capabilities would be even more impactful with the development of contrast materials designed to complement the existing clinical iodine- and barium-based agents. New biocompatible high-atomic number contrast materials with different biodistribution and X-ray attenuation properties than existing agents will expand the diagnostic power of spectral CT imaging without penalties in radiation dose or scan time.},

abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a powerful, non-invasive diagnostic medical imaging technique widely used to acquire detailed information about anatomy and function of different organs in the body, in both health and disease. It utilizes electromagnetic fields of three different frequency bands: static magnetic field (SMF), time-varying gradient magnetic fields (GMF) in the kHz range and pulsed radiofrequency fields (RF) in the MHz range. There have been some investigations examining the extent of genetic damage following exposure of bacterial and human cells to all three frequency bands of electromagnetic fields, as used during MRI: the rationale for these studies is the well documented evidence of positive correlation between significantly increased genetic damage and carcinogenesis. Overall, the published data were not sufficiently informative and useful because of the small sample size, inappropriate comparison of experimental groups, etc. Besides, when an increased damage was observed in MRI-exposed cells, the fate of such lesions was not further explored from multiple ‘down-stream' events. This review provides: (i) information on the basic principles used in MRI technology, (ii) detailed experimental protocols, results and critical comments on the genetic damage investigations thus far conducted using MRI equipment and, (iii) a discussion on several gaps in knowledge in the current scientific literature on MRI. Comprehensive, international, multi-centered collaborative studies, using a common and widely used MRI exposure protocol (cardiac or brain scan) incorporating several genetic/epigenetic damage end-points as well as epidemiological investigations, in large number of individuals/patients are warranted to reduce and perhaps, eliminate uncertainties raised in genetic damage investigations in cells exposed in vitro and in vivo to MRI.},

Five patients with localized prostate cancer, imaged with four MRI sequences (spin echo (SE) T1, turbo SE (TSE) T2, high resolution TSE (HR) T2, and FLASH 3D (F3D)), compared with their corresponding CT planning scans. Segmentation ability of the following pelvic structures: prostatic apex (PA), prostate, rectum, bladder and seminal vesicles (SV), were evaluated by three independent observers. They used a five point grading scale based on the anatomical definition of the organ boundary, tissue contrast and multiplanar display. Results were averaged for the group and for each sequence. There was no significant interobserver variation in the assessed scores (p {\textgreater} 0.1). The average scores (+/- 1 SD) for all pelvic structures assessed by each imaging sequence were CT 1.3 +/- 0.6; SE T1 2.4 +/- 0.9; TSE T2 2.4 +/- 0.7; HR T2 2.2 +/- 0.7 and F3D 3.4 +/- 0.6. Compared with CT, the average MR score for each assessed pelvic structure was higher with a trend for all transaxial MR sequences to provide improved segmentation of the PA and rectum. The F3D sequence scored highest as it provided multiplanar views and avoided the problem of partial volume averaging. MRI, compared with CT, appears to provide improved definition of pelvic treatment volumes but further work is required to confirm this and to address the issues of MRI associated distortion and dosimetry before MRI can be used routinely for pelvic radiotherapy planning.},

abstract = {PURPOSE
To compare tumor bed (TB) volumes delineated using magnetic resonance imaging plus computed tomography and clips (MRCT) with those delineated using CT and clips (CT/clips) alone in postlumpectomy breast cancer patients positioned prone and to determine the value of MRCT for planning partial breast irradiation (PBI). 

METHODS AND MATERIALS
Thirty women with breast cancer each had 6 to 12 titanium clips secured in the excision cavity walls at lumpectomy. Patients underwent CT imaging in the prone position, followed by MRI (T1-weighted [standard and fat-suppressed] and T2-weighted sequences) in the prone position. TB volumes were delineated separately on CT and on fused MRCT datasets. Clinical target volumes (CTV) (where CTV = TB + 15 mm) and planning target volumes (PTV) (where PTV = CTV + 10 mm) were generated. Conformity indices between CT- and MRCT-defined target volumes were calculated (ratio of the volume of agreement to total delineated volume). Discordance was expressed as a geographical miss index (GMI) (where the GMI = the fraction of total delineated volume not defined by CT) and a normal tissue index (the fraction of total delineated volume designated as normal tissue on MRCT). PBI dose distributions were generated to cover CT-defined CTV (CTVCT) with ≥95{\%} of the reference dose. The percentage of MRCT-defined CTV (CTVMRCT) receiving ≥95{\%} of the reference dose was measured. 

RESULTS
Mean conformity indices were 0.54 (TB), 0.84 (CTV), and 0.89 (PTV). For TB volumes, the GMI was 0.37, and the NTI was 0.09. Median percentage volume coverage of CTVCT was 97.1{\%} (range, 95.3{\%}–100.0{\%}) and of CTVMRCT was 96.5{\%} (range, 89.0{\%}–100.0{\%}). 

CONCLUSIONS
Addition of MR to CT/clip data generated TB volumes that were discordant with those based on CT/clips alone. However, clinically satisfactory coverage of CTVMRCT by CTVCT-based tangential PBI fields provides support for CT/clip-based TB delineation remaining the method of choice for PBI/breast boost radiotherapy planned using tangential fields.},

abstract = {Many promising MRI approaches for research or clinical management of multiple sclerosis (MS) have recently emerged, or are under development or refinement. Advanced MRI methods need to be assessed to determine whether they allow earlier diagnosis or better identification of phenotypes. Improved post-processing should allow more efficient and complete extraction of information from images. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy should improve in sensitivity and specificity with higher field strengths and should enable the detection of a wider array of metabolites. Diffusion imaging is moving closer to the goal of defining structural connectivity and, thereby, determining the functional significance of lesions at specific locations. Cell-specific imaging now seems feasible with new magnetic resonance contrast agents. The imaging of myelin water fraction brings the hope of providing a specific measure of myelin content. Ultra-high-field MRI increases sensitivity, but also presents new technical challenges. Here, we review these recent developments in MRI for MS, and also look forward to refinements in spinal-cord imaging, optic-nerve imaging, perfusion MRI, and functional MRI. Advances in MRI should improve our ability to diagnose, monitor, and understand the pathophysiology of MS.},

@article{Heesakkers2008,
abstract = {BACKGROUND
In patients with prostate cancer who are deemed to be at intermediate or high risk of having nodal metastases, invasive diagnostic pelvic lymph-node dissection (PLND) is the gold standard for the detection of nodal disease. However, a new lymph-node-specific MR-contrast agent ferumoxtran-10 can detect metastases in normal-sized nodes (ie, {\textless}8 mm in size) by use of MR lymphoangiography (MRL). In this prospective, multicentre cohort study, we aimed to compare the diagnostic accuracy of MRL with up-to-date multidetector CT (MDCT), and test the hypothesis that a negative MRL finding obviates the need for a PLND. 

METHODS
We included consecutive patients with prostate cancer who had an intermediate or high risk (risk of {\textgreater}5{\%} according to routinely used nomograms) of having lymph-node metastases. All patients were assessed by MDCT and MRL, and underwent PLND or fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Imaging results were correlated with histopathology. The primary outcomes were sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, NPV, and PPV of MRL and MDCT. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00185029. 

FINDINGS
The study was done in 11 hospitals in the Netherlands between April 8, 2003, and April 19, 2005. 375 consecutive patients were included. 61 of 375 (16{\%}) patients had lymph-node metastases. Sensitivity was 34{\%} (21 of 61; 95{\%} CI 23–48) for MDCT and 82{\%} (50 of 61; 70–90) for MRL (McNemar's test p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}05). Specificity was 97{\%} (303 of 314; 94–98) for MDCT and 93{\%} (291 of 314; 89–95) for MRL. Positive predictive value (PPV) was 66{\%} (21 of 32; 47–81) for MDCT and 69{\%} (50 of 73; 56–79) for MRL. Negative predictive value (NPV) was 88{\%} (303 of 343; 84–91) for MDCT and 96{\%} (291 of 302; 93–98) for MRL (McNemar's test p{\textless}0{\textperiodcentered}05). Of the 61 patients with lymph-node metastases, 50 were detected by MRL, of which 40 (80{\%}) had metastases in normal-sized lymph nodes. The high sensitivity and NPV of MRL imply that in patients with a negative MRL, the chance of positive lymph nodes is less than 11/302 (4{\%}). 

INTERPRETATION
MRL had significantly higher sensitivity and NPV than MDCT for patients with prostate cancer who had intermediate or high risk of having lymph-node metastases. In such patients, after a negative MRL, the post-test probability of having lymph-node metastases is low enough to omit a PLND.

abstract = {PURPOSE
To compare the quality of computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in target delineation of hepatocellular carcinoma. 

PATIENTS AND METHODS
Thirty-one patients with hepatocellular carcinoma received CT and MRI (including diffusion-weighted imaging [DWI]) before surgery. The maximal measurement on axial imaging and pathologic examination were extracted for statistical analysis. 

RESULTS
CT, MRI, DWI-based tumour size correlated well with pathologic sizes, r=0.974, 0.969, 0.964 respectively. But Wilcoxon signed-ranked test showed that differences did exist. CT overestimated the tumour size by 2.9mm compared to pathology (95{\%} CI: -13.2 to 7.4mm). The agreement of MRI-pathology seemed to be worse than CT, with a mean difference of 3.6mm (95{\%} CI: -14.7 to 7.7mm). The worst agreement was in DWI-pathology, with a mean difference of 5mm (95{\%} CI: -17.9 to 7.9mm). But significant difference was found neither between CT and MRI (P=0.477) nor between MRI and DWI (P=0.079). 

CONCLUSIONS
CT and MRI-based tumour size correlated well with pathologic size, but differences did exist. Most of the lesions were overestimated by CT and MRI. CT and MRI were similar in the guidance of target delineation, and DWI had added little value to MRI. A margin of 10mm around the gross tumour volume to become the clinical target volume is likely not sufficient. 

OBJECTIFS
Comparer la scanographie et l'IRM dans la d{\'{e}}lin{\'{e}}ation du volume cible dans le carcinome h{\'{e}}patocellulaire. 

PATIENTS ET M{\'{E}}THODES
Les 31 patients atteints de carcinome h{\'{e}}patocellulaire ont eu une scanographie et une IRM (avec des images pond{\'{e}}r{\'{e}}es en diffusion) avant la chirurgie. Les tailles maximales sur l'imagerie axiale et l'examen anatomopathologique ont {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} compar{\'{e}}es statistiquement. 

R{\'{E}}SULTATS
Les tailles des tumeurs d'apr{\`{e}}s la scanographie, l'IRM, et l'IRM de diffusion sont bien corr{\'{e}}l{\'{e}}es avec celles de l'examen anatomopathologique, respectivement r=0,974, 0,969 et 0,964, mais le test de Wilcoxon a montr{\'{e}} une diff{\'{e}}rence. La scanographie a surestim{\'{e}} la taille de la tumeur en moyenne de 2,9mm par rapport {\`{a}} l'examen anatomopathologique (intervalle de confiance {\`{a}} 95 {\%} [IC95{\%}] : -13,2-7,4mm), l'IRM de 3,6mm (IC 95 {\%} : -14,7-7,7mm) et l'IRM de diffusion de 5mm (IC 95 {\%} : -17,9-7,9mm). Il n'a cependant pas {\'{e}}t{\'{e}} trouv{\'{e}} de diff{\'{e}}rence entre la scanographie et l'IRM (p=0,477), ni entre l'IRM et l'IRM de diffusion (p=0,079). 

CONCLUSIONS
Il y a une bonne corr{\'{e}}lation entre la taille de la tumeur sur la scanographie et l'IRM et celle sur l'examen anatomopathologique, mais il existe des diff{\'{e}}rences. La plupart des l{\'{e}}sions sont surestim{\'{e}}es par la scanographie et l'IRM. La scanographie et l'IRM se sont av{\'{e}}r{\'{e}}es similaires dans la d{\'{e}}lin{\'{e}}ation de la cible, et l'IRM de diffusion a eu peu d'int{\'{e}}r{\^{e}}t. Une marge de 10mm entre volume tumoral macroscopique et le volume cible anatomoclinique n'est probablement pas suffisante.},

abstract = {Orthopaedic fracture fixation implants are increasingly being designed using accurate 3D models of long bones based on computer tomography (CT). Unlike CT, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) does not involve ionising radiation and is therefore a desirable alternative to CT. This study aims to quantify the accuracy of MRI-based 3D models compared to CT-based 3D models of long bones. The femora of five intact cadaver ovine limbs were scanned using a 1.5T MRI and a CT scanner. Image segmentation of CT and MRI data was performed using a multi-threshold segmentation method. Reference models were generated by digitising the bone surfaces free of soft tissue with a mechanical contact scanner. The MRI- and CT-derived models were validated against the reference models. The results demonstrated that the CT-based models contained an average error of 0.15mm while the MRI-based models contained an average error of 0.23mm. Statistical validation shows that there are no significant differences between 3D models based on CT and MRI data. These results indicate that the geometric accuracy of MRI based 3D models was comparable to that of CT-based models and therefore MRI is a potential alternative to CT for generation of 3D models with high geometric accuracy.},

abstract = {AbstractBackground and purpose. In radiotherapy (RT), target soft tissues are best defined on MR images. In several cases, CT imaging is needed only for dose calculation and generation of digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs). Image co-registration errors between MRI and CT can be avoided by using MRI-only based treatment planning, especially in the pelvis. Since electron density information can not be directly derived from the MRI, a method is needed to convert MRI data into CT like data. We investigated whether there is a relationship between MRI intensity and Hounsfield unit (HU) values for the pelvic bones. The aim was to generate a method to convert bone MRI intensity into HU data surrogate for RT treatment planning. Material and methods. The HU conversion model was generated for 10 randomly chosen prostate cancer patients and independent validation was performed in another 10 patients. Data consisted of 800 image voxels chosen within the pelvic bones in both T1/T2*-weighted gradient echo and CT...},

@article{Giezen2012,
abstract = {PURPOSE
To examine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) for lumpectomy cavity (LC) volume delineation in supine radiotherapy treatment position and to assess the interobserver variability. 

METHODS AND MATERIALS
A total of 15 breast cancer patients underwent a planning CT and directly afterward MRI in supine radiotherapy treatment position. Then, 4 observers (2 radiation oncologists and 2 radiologists) delineated the LC on the CT and MRI scans and assessed the cavity visualization score (CVS). The CVS, LC volume, conformity index (CI), mean shift of the center of mass (COM), with the standard deviation, were quantified for both CT and MRI. 

RESULTS
The CVS showed that MRI and CT provide about equal optimal visibility of the LC. If the CVS was high, magnetic resonance imaging provided more detail of the interfaces of the LC seroma with the unaffected GBT. MRI also pictured in more detail the interfaces of axillary seromas (if present) with their surroundings and their relationship to the LC. Three observers delineated smaller, and one observer larger, LC volumes comparing the MRI- and CT-derived delineations. The mean ± standard deviation CI was 32{\%} ± 25{\%} for MRI and 52{\%} ± 21{\%} for CT. The mean ± standard deviation COM shift was 11 ± 10 mm (range 1–36) for MRI and 4 ± 3 mm (range 1–10) for CT. 

CONCLUSIONS
MRI does not add additional information to CT in cases in which the CVS is assessed as low. The conformity (CI) is lower for MRI than for CT, especially at a low CVS owing to greater COM shifts for MRI, probably caused by inadequate visibility of the surgical clips on magnetic resonance (MR) images. The COM shifts seriously dictate a decline in the CI more than the variability of the LC volumes does. In cases in which MRI provides additional information, MRI must be combined with the CT/surgical clip data.},

abstract = {AIM
This study represents an enumeration and comparison of gross target volumes (GTV) as delineated independently on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and T1 and T2 weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in vestibular schwannomas (VS). 

BACKGROUND
Multiple imaging in radiotherapy improves target localization. 

METHODS AND MATERIALS
42 patients of VS were considered for this prospective study with one patient showing bilateral tumor. The GTV was delineated separately on CT and MRI. Difference in volumes were estimated individually for all the 43 lesions and similarity was studied between CT and T1 and T2 weighted MRI. 

RESULTS
The male to female ratio for VS was found to be 1:1.3. The tumor was right sided in 34.9{\%} and left sided in 65.1{\%}. Tumor volumes (TV) on CT image sets were ranging from 0.251cc to 27.27cc. The TV for CT, MRI T1 and T2 weighted were 5.15±5.2cc, 5.8±6.23cc, and 5.9±6.13cc, respectively. Compared to MRI, CT underestimated the volumes. The mean dice coefficient between CT versus T1 and CT versus T2 was estimated to be 68.85±18.3 and 66.68±20.3, respectively. The percentage of volume difference between CT and MRI ({\%}VD: mean±SD for T1; 28.84±15.0, T2; 35.74±16.3) and volume error ({\%}VE: T1; 18.77±10.1, T2; 23.17±13.93) were found to be significant, taking the CT volumes as the baseline. 

CONCLUSIONS
MRI with multiple sequences should be incorporated for tumor volume delineation and they provide a clear boundary between the tumor and normal tissue with critical structures nearby.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES
Patients presenting with hip pain but normal plain radiographs may ultimately be shown on further investigation to have suffered an occult hip fracture (OHF). This diagnosis can be made with CT or MRI. Traditionally MRI has been considered a superior modality. We performed a retrospective review of all patients presenting to our service with a suspected OHF over a four-year period, investigated with either CT or MRI. 

DESIGN
Retrospective review. 

SETTING
Urban trauma centre. 

PATIENTS
Patients with suspected hip fractures and negative radiographs. 

INTERVENTION
CT or MRI. 

MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES
Detection rate; delay in request for further imaging; delay to theatre; re-presentations with missed fractures. 

RESULTS
A total of 179 patients were investigated, with a mean age of 82±13 years. The ultimate diagnosis was of an OHF in 71 cases and pelvic or acetabular fracture in 34. The average time from presentation plain radiograph to further imaging was 2.0±2.7 days, but was significantly shorter for CT. No patient re-presented with unidentified fractures or other localised hip pathology within a 12-month period. 

CONCLUSIONS
Modern imaging technology does not appear to miss clinically significant fractures. As CT is usually more accessible than MRI, the results of our study should encourage surgeons to consider CT as a first line investigation for occult hip fractures. We advocate a high index of suspicion and early imaging referral for elderly patients presenting with non-specific hip pain following a fall. Level 3 Evidence.},

abstract = {The objective of this study was to evaluate two issues regarding magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including device functionality and image artifacts for the presence of radio frequency identification devices (RFID) in association with 0.3 Tesla at 12.7 MHz MRI and computed tomography (CT) scanning. Fifteen samples of RFID tags with two different sizes (wristband and ID card types) were tested. The tags were exposed to several MR-imaging conditions during MRI examination and X-rays of CT scan. Throughout the test, the tags were oriented in three different directions (axial, coronal, and sagittal) relative to MRI system in order to cover all possible situations with respect to the patient undergoing MRI and CT scanning, wearing a RFID tag on wrist. We observed that the tags did not sustain physical damage with their functionality remaining unaffected even after MRI and CT scanning, and there was no alternation in previously stored data as well. In addition, no evidence of either signal loss or artifact was seen in the acquired MR and CT images. Therefore, we can conclude that the use of this passive RFID tag is safe for a patient undergoing MRI at 0.3 T/12.7 MHz and CT Scanning.},
